for longer, the banking royal commission has recommended sweeping changes to the sector.<\/p>\r\nCommissioner Kenneth Hayne's final report offers 76 recommendations, all of which the Federal Government and Labor say they will support and implement.\r\n\r\nSo what's in it?\r\n<h2>Fees for no service<\/h2>\r\nThe final report recommends financial watchdogs consider criminal charges against unnamed organisations linked to the \"fees for no service\" scandal.\r\n\r\nThe royal commission heard cases of customers being charged for services they had never received.\r\n\r\nThe most scandalous of cases involved people being charged these fees even after they had died.\r\n\r\nThe final report estimated the scandal would cost wealth managers and the major banks $850 million in compensation.\r\n\r\nBut it has not recommended the banks and wealth managers from being banned from owning advice businesses.\r\n<h2>Superannuation<\/h2>\r\nASIC will become the primary conduct regulator overseeing superannuation.\r\n\r\nIt and APRA will receive extra power by creating civil penalties for breaches of laws governing superannuation trustees and directors.\r\n\r\nThe commission has recommended deductions of any advice fees should be prohibited from a MySuper account.\r\n\r\nFees from non-My Super accounts must meet annual disclosure agreements.\r\n\r\nHawking of superannuation products will also be prohibited in a bid to prevent people being sold superannuation products in an unsolicited manner that can lead to people selecting products not in their best interest.\r\n\r\nThe commission has also recommended the banking executive accountability regime (BEAR), which governs who is responsible when issues arise, should be applied to the superannuation sector.\r\n\r\nThere will also be new protections to ensure superannuation fund members only have one default account.\r\n<h2>Farms and small business<\/h2>\r\nFarmers have long complained about the treatment they receive from banks and were among the most effective campaigners that lobbied for a royal commission.\r\n\r\nThe Government has now agreed to create a national farm-debt-mediation scheme that would assist borrowers to address financial difficulties that have caused loans to become distressed.\r\n<div class=\"inline-content wysiwyg right accessible\">\r\n<div class=\"inner\">\r\n<h2>The possibility of an early election<\/h2>\r\n<a title=\"\" href=\"https:\/\/www.abc.net.au\/news\/2019-02-04\/signs-government-panicking-over-possibility-of-early-election\/10777314\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"float--none\" src=\"https:\/\/www.abc.net.au\/cm\/lb\/10779116\/data\/scott-morrison-early-election-scare-data.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-alt=\"Early election to avoid losing a vote in parliament\" \/>\r\nThere are signs the Government is panicking over possibly losing a vote in the coming parliamentary sitting and bringing on an election, writes Laura Tingle.<\/a>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\nThe Government wants banks to ensure mediation occurs soon after a loan becomes distressed and not as a final measure before lenders take enforcement action.\r\n\r\nThe commissioner has urged banks to ensure agricultural-land valuations are carried out independently of lenders assessing new loans and consider the possible effect of external events that might be needed to sell the land for a fair value.\r\n\r\nThe report also calls on banks to ensure distressed agricultural loans are managed by experienced agri-bankers.\r\n\r\nIt also wants banks to recognise that the appointment of receivers or external administrators should only be a remedy of last resort.\r\n\r\nThe report calls for the Australian Bankers' Association to amend its banking code to define \"small business\" as any business employing fewer than 100 full-time-equivalent employees, where the loan applied for is less than $5 million.\r\n<h2>Compensation for consumers<\/h2>\r\nThe Government will establish a so-called compensation scheme of last resort to allow consumers and small businesses, who have been failed by financial firms, to have their cases heard.\r\n\r\nThe scheme will pay compensation where a court or tribunal has ruled in a consumer's favour, or if the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (ACFA) has issued a determination, but they are unable to get compensation from the financial firm responsible, possibly because the firm has become insolvent.\r\n\r\n\"This will be a scheme paid for by industry reflecting their obligation to right their wrongs,\" Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said.\r\n\r\nThe Government will also pay $30 million to about 300 consumers and small businesses for unpaid determinations from the Financial Ombudsman Service and Credit and Investments Ombudsman.\r\n<h2>Financial industry regulators<\/h2>\r\nThe royal commission has recommended retaining the twin peaks model for financial regulation but wants there to be a clearer division between the roles of the regulators.\r\n\r\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) will retain responsibility for prudential regulation, while the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) will primarily regulate conduct and disclosure.\r\n\r\nMr Hayne urged ASIC to launch legal action when dealing with large corporations, rather than just issuing infringement notices when they breach laws. He said infringement notices should only be used in administrative matters.\r\n\r\n\"Misconduct will be deterred only if entities believe that misconduct will be detected, denounced and justly punished,\" he wrote in his report.","post_title":"A CRISIS OF LEADERSHIP?

This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data that we hold about you corrected, although we may need to verify the accuracy of the new personal data that you provide to us.Request erasure&nbsp;of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your personal data unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Please note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.Object to processing&nbsp;of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your personal data which override your rights and freedoms.Request restriction of processing&nbsp;of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.Request the transfer&nbsp;of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.Withdraw consent at any time&nbsp;where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d (or similar) links on any marketing message sent to you or by contacting us at any time.
